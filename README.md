```
baseUrl: http://localhost:3000/api
userToken: (set after login)
adminToken: (set after admin login)
usdCurrencyId: (set after creating USD currency)
recipientId: (set after creating second user)
```

### 2. Test Flow

       "firstName": "John",
       "lastName": "Doe"
   }
   ```

2. Register an admin user:
   ```json
   POST /api/users/register
   {
       "email": "admin@example.com",
       "password": "admin123",
       "firstName": "Admin",
       "lastName": "User",
       "isAdmin": true
   }
   ```

3. Login and save tokens:
   ```json
   POST /api/users/login
   {
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "password123"
   }
   ```

#### B. Currency Setup (Admin)
1. Create USD currency:
   ```json
   POST /api/currencies
   {
       "code": "USD",
       "name": "US Dollar",
       "symbol": "$",
       "exchangeRate": 1.0
   }
   ```

2. Create EUR currency:
   ```json
   POST /api/currencies
   {
       "code": "EUR",
       "name": "Euro",
       "symbol": "â‚¬",
       "exchangeRate": 1.1
   }
   ```

#### C. Transaction Flow
1. Make a deposit:
   ```json
   POST /api/transactions/deposit
   {
       "amount": 1000,
       "currencyId": "{{usdCurrencyId}}",
       "description": "Initial deposit"
   }
   ```

2. Make a withdrawal:
   ```json
   POST /api/transactions/withdraw
   {
       "amount": 100,
       "currencyId": "{{usdCurrencyId}}",
       "description": "ATM withdrawal"
   }
   ```

3. Transfer to another user:
   ```json
   POST /api/transactions/transfer
   {
       "recipientId": "{{recipientId}}",
       "amount": 50,
       "currencyId": "{{usdCurrencyId}}",
       "description": "Payment for services"
   }
   ```

#### D. Fraud Detection Demo
1. Make multiple rapid transactions to trigger fraud detection
2. Make a large withdrawal to test amount-based flags
3. Check console for email alerts (in development mode)

#### E. Admin Features
1. View flagged transactions:
   ```
   GET /api/transactions/flagged
   ```

2. Update exchange rates:
   ```json
   PUT /api/currencies/EUR/exchange-rate
